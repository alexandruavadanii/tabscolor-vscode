## About tabscolor

![Title background](./docs/demo.gif)

This extension lets you color the background of your editor tabs without using any commands. Useful when working on a project with multiple tabs. 
The extension is still in an experimental phase.

## How to use

Install the extension, restart your vs code (not just reload), right click on any tab and chose "color"

## This extension can :

- change the background color of any tab header from the contextual menu

## This extension can't (yet) :

- change the whole background of the tab page

- assign colors to tabs based on regex

- set custom colors

## Notes :

- this extension uses patching in order to allow tabs style editing, if your vs code files are read-only then Tabscolor may not work.

## Available commands:

- clear all tabs colors
